# Score Board

## Purpose of Services

- **socket.io:** Manages real-time scoreboard updates for users, utilizing `socket.broadcast.emit` to notify when the top user is updated.
- **Score class:** Handles CRUD operations related to user scores.
- **Redis:** Acts as a caching layer to temporarily store top 10 user data, enhancing application speed and real-time responsiveness.
- **Database:** Stores persistent data such as user profiles, scores, and permissions.

## Workflow Notes

- The diagram simplifies complex processes by omitting some feedback loops like `(<---------message)` like: client connection setup with socket.io,...

## Additional Improvements

- **Optimized Redis Usage:** Redis efficiently handles caching and logic for top user sorting. For instance, scores above the 10th position can conditionally update a Redis SET. Using `ZREVRANGE`, we can fetch sorted user data to update clients.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement logging and metric monitoring to oversee system operations.
- **Enhanced Security:** Besides permission checks, consider implementing rate limiting to prevent unauthorized score increases.
